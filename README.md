# üåü Customer Churn Prediction  

## üìñ Overview  
This repository contains a project focused on predicting customer churn in the telecommunications industry. Leveraging advanced machine learning techniques and the CRISP-DM methodology, the project aims to identify key factors driving churn and provide actionable insights to enhance customer retention.  

## üéØ Objectives  
### Business Objectives  
1. **Enhance customer satisfaction** by identifying key factors driving churn.  
2. **Minimize churn rates** by identifying high-risk customers and implementing targeted retention strategies.  

### Data Science Objectives  
1. Build and evaluate machine learning models to determine the best-performing model and analyze key churn-driving features.  
2. Develop algorithms to forecast churn and cluster customers to interpret behavior patterns.  

## üìã Methodology  
This project follows the **CRISP-DM Framework**:  
1. **Business Understanding**: Define goals and objectives of churn prediction.  
2. **Data Understanding**: Analyze datasets to identify patterns and distributions.  
3. **Data Preparation**: Clean and preprocess data for machine learning.  
4. **Modeling**: Train and evaluate predictive models.  
5. **Evaluation**: Assess model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.  
6. **Deployment**: Deploy the best-performing model using Streamlit for real-world predictions.  

## üìä Dataset  
The datasets (`churn-bigml-20.csv` and `churn-bigml-80.csv`) consist of customer information collected by a telecom company.  

### Key Features  
- **State**: Customer's state (categorical).  
- **Account length**: Duration of account in days (numeric).  
- **Area code**: Customer's area code (numeric).  
- **International plan**: Presence of an international calling plan (Yes/No).  
- **Voice mail plan**: Presence of a voice mail plan (Yes/No).  
- **Service usage metrics**: Details on calls, charges, and minutes for daytime, evening, nighttime, and international calls.  
- **Customer service calls**: Number of calls to customer service (numeric).  
- **Churn**: Target variable indicating whether the customer churned (Yes/No).
